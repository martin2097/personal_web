Animations on websites can have different purposes - either aesthetic or they can be used to draw attention to 
specific elements. In this article we'll use two examples to show how we can use the project [`animate.css`](https://animate.style/) to add such animations to Dash applications.

### Setting up `animate.css`

`animate.css` is an open source project that provides a large number of animations ready to use. For a better overview, we can take a look at the official [documentation](https://animate.style/), which also serves as a gallery of available animations.

In order to use this animation library in our Dash application we will need to download the [css stylesheet from the 
github repository](https://github.com/animate-css/animate.css/blob/3235f27325ebc721fc4f8435d3c2d436642278bc/animate.css) into our `assets` folder (if you haven't worked with the `assets` folder before, see the [Dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/external-resources) for more information).

### Entrance animation

One of the uses of animations are entrance animations which are often encountered for example on personal pages - their main goal is to attract attention and create a pleasant first impression.

Let's imagine we're creating a project about why Dash is a great library. On the landing page we'll create a simple 
centered text generated by ChatGPT. For a better impression we'd like to animate this text using roll up from the bottom.

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash
  
app = Dash(__name__)
  
app.layout = dmc.Grid(
    [
        dmc.Col(
            dmc.Text(
                "Plotly Dash library is extremely useful for developers and data analysts for "
                "several reasons. With its simple interface and rich palette of components it "
                "is possible to quickly create interactive web applications allowing users to "
                "interact with data. This flexibility is supported by the ability to create "
                "different types of visualizations such as charts, tables and heatmaps which "
                "helps communicate information more effectively. Plotly Dash is built on "
                "Python making it easy to integrate with existing tools and libraries for data "
                "analysis. With this open-source tool and an active developer community you "
                "have access to regular updates and support. In addition the ease of deployment "
                "on different platforms makes Plotly Dash a great tool for sharing applications "
                "and integrating into different systems",
                size=20,
                weight=500,
            ),
            span=8,
            offset=2,
        )
    ],
    align="center",
    style={"width": "100vw", "height": "100vh"},
)
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

For components from the Dash Mantine Components library are animations added using the `className` parameter (for components from the Dash Bootstrap Components library we would use the `class_name` parameter). In this parameter we need to assign a string that contains `animate__animated` and then the name of the animation - in our case it will be `animate__fadeInUp`.  In addition to these basic options we can also assign the following [options](https://animate.style/#utilities):

**Animation speed:**

- `animate__slow` - duration 2s
- `animate__slower` - duration 3s
- `animate__fast` - duration 800ms
- `animate__faster` - duration 500ms
- without specifying the duration the animation will take 1s

**Delay in the start of animation:**

- `animate__delay-2s` - 2s
- `animate__delay-3s` - 3s
- `animate__delay-4s` - 4s
- `animate__delay-5s` - 5s

**Number of animation repetitions:**

- `animate__repeat-1` - 1x
- `animate__repeat-2` - 2x
- `animate__repeat-3` - 3x
- `animate__infinite` - infinite looping

In our example we'll speed up the animation by using the `animate__fast` option.

.. admonition::id of components
    :icon: mdi:alert

    If we use multiple animations of the same type on different components in our application it is necessary to add a unique id identifier to these components otherwise these animations won't trigger correctly.

Now we modify our code as follows:

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash
  
app = Dash(__name__)
  
app.layout = dmc.Grid(
    [
        dmc.Col(
            dmc.Text(
                "Plotly Dash library is extremely useful for developers and data analysts for "
                "several reasons. With its simple interface and rich palette of components it "
                "is possible to quickly create interactive web applications allowing users to "
                "interact with data. This flexibility is supported by the ability to create "
                "different types of visualizations such as charts, tables and heatmaps which "
                "helps communicate information more effectively. Plotly Dash is built on "
                "Python making it easy to integrate with existing tools and libraries for data "
                "analysis. With this open-source tool and an active developer community you "
                "have access to regular updates and support. In addition the ease of deployment "
                "on different platforms makes Plotly Dash a great tool for sharing applications "
                "and integrating into different systems",
                size=20,
                weight=500,
                id="animated-text",
                className="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__faster",
            ),
            span=8,
            offset=2,
        )
    ],
    align="center",
    style={"width": "100vw", "height": "100vh"},
)
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

.. exec::blog.media.dash_adding_animations_text_up_en
    :code: false
    :border: false

### Attention seeking

A common use of animations in applications is to draw attention to specific elements. For example to draw attention to the interactive elements.

In this example we will use the [`dmc.Accordion`](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/accordion) 
component. We would like to draw attention to the chevron in the panel using the `animate__flash` animation. This 
will let the user know that the panel can be clicked and the accordion opened. Thanks to the [Styles API](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/styles-api) - specifically the `classNames` parameter - we can add the 
animation just to the chevron using the `chevron` selector. In addition, we will make use of the `animate__delay-3s` 
(so that the animation doesn't start right when the page loads) and `animate__repeat-2` (so that the animation repeats twice).

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash
  
app = Dash(__name__)
  
app.layout = dmc.Stack(
    [
        dmc.Divider(
            label="Example Section",
            style={"width": "400px"},
            styles={"label": {"font-size": "20px", "font-weight": 600}},
        ),
        dmc.Accordion(
            children=[
                dmc.AccordionItem(
                    [
                        dmc.AccordionControl("Item"),
                        dmc.AccordionPanel("This is the first item of the accordion."),
                    ],
                    value="item",
                ),
                dmc.AccordionItem(
                    [
                        dmc.AccordionControl("Another item"),
                        dmc.AccordionPanel("Second item."),
                    ],
                    value="another-item",
                ),
                dmc.AccordionItem(
                    [
                        dmc.AccordionControl("Super secret item"),
                        dmc.AccordionPanel("BAZINGA!"),
                    ],
                    value="super-secret-item",
                ),
            ],
            chevronPosition="left",
            variant="separated",
            style={"width": "400px"},
            id="accordion",
            classNames={
                "chevron": "animate__animated animate__flash animate__delay-3s animate__repeat-2"
  },
        ),
    ],
    m=40,
)
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Conclusion

In this article we learned how to add animations to the Dash app. But let's not forget that animations should have a clear purpose and should not be overused ([Best Practice](https://animate.style/#best-practices) from the `animate.css` 
documentation).
